                <h1 class="page-title">We offer</h1>
                <p class="paper-font-headline">What can we do for you, and how is that useful?</p>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Solution Architecture</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">You don't need to throw money at endless documents and extravagant models.
                We will show you how a clean, targeted architecture can make your solution live longer, function cheaper and evolve better.
                We specialize in B2B / B2C omnichannel eCommerce and Hybris is our primary platform of choice.
                A good portion of our expertise relates to effective integration and messaging patterns.</p>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Technical Team Management</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">High velocity, code quality and low defect rate.
                Whatever you may think, these are actually possible for your team to achieve.
                We aim to improve throughput and quality by supplying guidance, removing blockers and selecting productive tools and efficient technologies.
                Java and Scala are our preferred languages though we are not afraid to handle any customer specific environment.</p>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Software Development</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">High risk? Demanding requirements? Unconventional implementation?
                Where others see only trouble, our developers see opportunity.
                We can rely on well balanced cross functional teams, with a mix of new learners and more senior engineers to provide the best possible value.
                Their skill set covers wide area of the eCommerce space, notably Hybris, Demandware and Magento.</p>

              <paper-material elevation="1" class="paper-font-body2">
                <h1 class="page-title">We deliver</h1>
                <p class="paper-font-headline">How do we work, and why is that important?</p>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Lean process</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">Time is on your side when you respect it.
                To get the best out of our time we practice agile architecture and lean team management.</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">Designing a system should not create cumbersome rules that are hard to escape from.
                Architecture primary objective is to reduce such fixed, solid state dependencies as much as possible in order to make change easier.
                It has to ensure a collective understanding of how to approach problems in flexible and consistent manner and the actual execution of common principles.
                We do:</p>
                <ul class="paper-font-subhead">
                  <li>Advise on cross cutting decisions.</li>
                  <li>Monitor codebase complexity.</li>
                  <li>Involve all technical stakeholders in design discussions and improvement work.</li>
                  <li>Create well written components to serve as standard.</li>
                  <li>Assess and define technical debt.</li>
                  <li>Review all code going into the repository.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">For us, lean does not associate with chaotic cowboy coding or general lack of structure and documentation.
                It just means getting the best value out of your efforts. We do:</p>
                <ul class="paper-font-subhead">
                  <li>Setup rapid deployments and regular client demonstrations.</li>
                  <li>Identify features that represent waste at the current stage.</li>
                  <li>Configure tools for automated build testing, integrity reports and simplified refactoring.</li>
                  <li>Encourage clients to discuss their ideas face to face with developers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Precise implementation</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">We remember well where the devil hides. Even little details are of great significance.
                Regardless how many and how fast things are moving, we have to keep track of how our system is supposed to work and how it performs in the real world.
                We want to make sure everything fits together like an original swiss clock. We use:</p>
                <ul class="paper-font-subhead">
                  <li>Incoming and outgoing data validation.</li>
                  <li>Alert, error and log analysis dashboards.</li>
                  <li>High load concurrency tests on user interactions, data flow, job execution and storage operations.</li>
                  <li>Reports on functional, integration and unit tests with their exceptional conditions coverage.</li>
                  <li>Simulation of production data in all test environments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paper-font-title">Reliable systems</p>
                <p class="paper-font-subhead">Nobody wants their software to fail or underperform, especially at the wrong time.
                It can cause financial loss, public embarrassment or for those unlucky enough, even legal issues.
                It is our business to guarantee our solutions come prepared for everything. We rely on:</p>
                <ul class="paper-font-subhead">
                  <li>Horizontally scalable, highly distributed systems.</li>
                  <li>On demand provisioning and allocation of cluster nodes.</li>
                  <li>Small, loosely coupled services with independent context.</li>
                  <li>Redundant components with good encapsulation and the ability to fail-fast.</li>
                  <li>Frameworks and libraries that are flexible, secure, well supported and regularly updated.</li>
                  <li>Scheduled maintenance and cleanup of data.</li>
                </ul>
